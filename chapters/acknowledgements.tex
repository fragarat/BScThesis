With this Bachelor's degree project, a fascinating stage ends and another one, that I hope it will be just as beautiful and exciting as the previous, begins. I want to thank all the teachers and classmates I have had throughout these three years. From each and every one of them I have learned, and am still learning, to be a better mathematician.

Special thanks to my supervisor, Viktor Linders, and my examiner, Philipp Birken, for their invaluable advice and recommendations from the beginning of this project.

Thanks to my family for their unconditional love.

And last but not least, thanks to my husband Alfredo, for believing in me more than myself and teaching me that with humility, work and effort, dreams can be achieved in life.

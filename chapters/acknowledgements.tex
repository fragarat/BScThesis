With this Bachelor's degree project, a fascinating journey ends and a new one begins. I would like to thank all the teachers and classmates I have had throughout these three years. From each and every one of them I have learned, and am still learning, to be a better mathematician.

Special thanks to my examiner Philipp Birken, for presenting me with a very interesting thesis subject, and to my supervisor, Viktor Linders, for his invaluable advice and guidance from the beginning of this project. 

Thanks to my family for their unconditional love.

Finally, and above all, this thesis work is dedicated to my lovely husband, Alfredo, who has been a constant source of love and support. Thanks for believing in me more than myself and teaching me that with humility, work and effort, dreams can be achieved in life.

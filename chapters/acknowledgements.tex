A formal document usually has an acknowledgment page found in the end page. Try to avoid personal thoughts which aren't appropriate, especially if the document deals with a very technical subject. Rather, you can write the acknowledgment in such a manner that it would sound professional. Do this by making it short and more informal compared the other parts of your work.

Be specific when talking about those people who supported you in your work. Put a lot of thought into this portion of your document. There are also some cases where the people who helped you would feel uncomfortable if their support is less emphasized over the others. To dismiss this thought, simply list the names alphabetically. This is perfectly acceptable.

\chapter{Continuous-time analysis of dynamical systems}
\label{chap:cont}
When analyzing the importance of certain individuals within a network, it's important to consider the order in which these interactions occur in time. It happens that if person A meets person B today and then person B meets person C tomorrow, a message or idea could pass from A to C, but not the other way around. If we only look at individual moments in time (static snapshots) or a summary of all the interactions, we may miss this type of influence, making it difficult to identify key players in the network. It's reasonable to assume then that influential individuals will come up with ideas that are then passed around the network by others. Our main motivation is therefore to introduce a framework that can efficiently measure these effects in a continuous-time setting.
